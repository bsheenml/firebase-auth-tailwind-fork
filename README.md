### Firebase Authorization - React + Tailwind + Reach Router

This project forks the source code of [LogRocket React + Firebase Auth](https://blog.logrocket.com/user-authentication-firebase-react-apps/) and configures with my Firebase Services.

See Demo: [https://auth-firebase-tailwind.firebaseapp.com/](https://auth-firebase-tailwind.firebaseapp.com/)

## Motivation

Originally attempted to recreate from blank Create React App.
Returned errors. Bootstrapping to debug my codebase.
Original Project:
[firebase-auth-tailwind](https://github.com/bsheenml/firebase-auth-tailwind/)

## Installation

`npm install`
`npm start`
